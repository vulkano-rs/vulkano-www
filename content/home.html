            <h3>Safe</h3>

            <p>Vulkano follows the Rust definition of safety. It should be impossible for
                the user to get any undefined behavior using safe code, even when that code seems
                absurd.</p>

            <p><small><em>Note: while total safety is vulkano's goal,
                                it isn't fulfilled yet.</em></small></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Predictable</h3>

            <p>The actual Vulkan functions called by vulkano are precisely documented, making
                vulkano very easy to profile or debug with Vulkan tools.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Efficient</h3>

            <p>Vulkano tries to have as little runtime overhead as possible by moving some elements
                to compile-time, while still maintaining safety.
            </p>

            <p><small><em>Note: computing more information at compile-time is blocked waiting for
                                some upcoming Rust features.</em></small></p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Convenient</h3>

            <p>Vulkano provides convenient methods on top of Vulkan in order to make it more
                convenient to use.</p>
