# Creating an image

In [the buffers creation section of the guide](/guide/buffer-creation) we saw that in order for
the GPU to access data we had to put it in a *buffer*.
This is not exactly true, as there is an alternative which are ***images***.

An *image* in the context of Vulkan designates a multidimensional array of pixels, where each
pixels has a specific format amongst a list of hardcoded formats.

We often use Vulkan images to store *images* in the common sense of the word, in which case each
value of the array contains the color of the pixel. However keep in mind that Vulkan images can
also be used to store arbitrary data (in other words, not just colors).

## Properties of an image

While we often think of images as being two-dimensional, in the context of Vulkan they can also be
one-dimensional or three-dimensional. The dimensions of an image are chosen when you create it.

> to be contiguous, while for the latter you can manage layers individually as if they were
> separate two-dimensional images.

When you create an image you must also choose a format for its pixels. Depending on the format, the
pixels of an image can have between one and four components. In other words each pixel is an array
of one to four values. The four components are named, in order, R, G, B and A.

You can check [the list of available formats
here](https://docs.rs/vulkano/0.7/vulkano/format/enum.Format.html).

For example if you create an image with the format `R8Sint`, then it will only have one component.
But with the format `A2R10G10B10SscaledPack32`, you have all four components. The first part of the
name of each format corresponds to the memory layout of the four components. For example with
`B10G11R11UfloatPack32`, each pixel is 32 bits long where the first 10 bits is the blue component,
the next 11 bits are the green component, and the last 11 bits are the red component. Don't worry
if you are confused, as we will only use the most simple formats in this guide.

## Image creation

Creating an image is very similar to creating a buffer. Just like there are multiple different
structs in vulkano that represent buffers, there are also multiple different structs that
represent images. Here we are going to use a *StorageImage*, which is a general-purpose image.

> **Note**: In practice the `StorageImage` is recommended for storing general-purpose values for
> usage in shaders, like you would use a buffer. It is not recommended for storing actual images.

```rust
use vulkano::format::Format;
use vulkano::image::Dimensions;
use vulkano::image::StorageImage;

let image = StorageImage::new(device.clone(), Dimensions::Dim2d { width: 1024, height: 1024 },
                              Format::R8G8B8A8Unorm, Some(queue.family())).unwrap();
```

As explained above we pass the dimensions of the image and its format. The queue family to use is
similar to the parameter when creating a buffer. It indicates which queue families are going to
access the image.

> **Note**: Images also have usage flags similar to buffers, but this precise constructor doesn't
> require them.
