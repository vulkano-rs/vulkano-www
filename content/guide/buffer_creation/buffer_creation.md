# Creating a buffer

When using Vulkan, you will very often need the GPU to read or write data in memory. In fact
there isn't much point in using the GPU otherwise, as there is nothing you can do with the results
of its work except write them to memory.

In order for the GPU to be able to access some data (either for reading, writing or both), we
first need to create a ***buffer*** object and put the data in it.

## Several kinds of buffers

Vulkano does **not** provide a generic `Buffer` struct which you could create with `Buffer::new`.
Instead, it provides several different structs that all represent buffers, each of these structs
being optimized for a certain kind of usage. For example, if you want to continuously upload data
to the GPU, you should use a `CpuBufferPool`; on the other hand, if you have some data that
will largely remain visible only to the GPU, a `DeviceLocalBuffer` brings increased performance at the
cost of more complicated data access from the CPU.

The most simple kind of buffer that exists is the `CpuAccessibleBuffer`, which can be created
like this:

```rust
use vulkano::buffer::{BufferUsage, CpuAccessibleBuffer};

let data: i32 = 12;
let buffer = CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_data(
    device.clone(),
    BufferUsage {
        uniform_buffer: true,
        ..Default::default()
    },
    false,
    data,
)
.expect("failed to create buffer");
```

We have to indicate several things when creating the buffer. The first parameter is the device
to use. Since `device` is actually an `Arc<Device>`, the call to `.clone()` only clones the `Arc`
which isn't expensive. You should get used to passing the device as a parameter, as you will
need to do so for most of the Vulkan objects that you create.

The second parameter indicates [which purpose we are creating the
buffer](https://docs.rs/vulkano/0.31.0/vulkano/buffer/struct.BufferUsage.html) for, which can help the
implementation perform some optimizations. Trying to use a buffer in a way that wasn't indicated in
its constructor will result in an error. For the sake of the example, we just create a
`BufferUsage` that supports being used as a uniform buffer.

The third parameter indicates if the buffer should be CPU cached. This should rarely be true for most
use cases, but in some cases where the application is writing data to the GPU through this buffer continuously,
setting this parameter to true may yield some performance gain. This parameter should not be true if
the user intends to read results from the GPU from this buffer as GPU changes may not reflect.

Finally, the fourth parameter is the content of the buffer. Here we create a buffer
that contains a single integer with the value `12`.

> **Note**: In a real application you shouldn't create buffers with only 4 bytes of data. Although
> buffers aren't expensive, you should try to group as much related data as you can in the same buffer.

## From_data and from_iter

In the example above we create a buffer that contains the value `12`, which is of type `i32`.
but you can put any type you want in a buffer, there is no restriction. In order to give our
arbitrary types a representation that can be used in a generic way, we use the crate `bytemuck`
and its "plain old data" trait, `Pod`. Thus, we add the following dependency to our Cargo.toml:

```toml
bytemuck = "1.12.1"
```

After that you can, for example, write this:

```rust
use bytemuck::{Pod, Zeroable};

// here we derive all these traits to ensure the data behaves as simple as possible
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Default, Copy, Clone, Zeroable, Pod)]
struct MyStruct {
    a: u32,
    b: u32,
}

let data = MyStruct { a: 5, b: 69 };

let buffer = CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_data(
    device.clone(),
    BufferUsage {
        uniform_buffer: true,
        ..Default::default()
    },
    false,
    data,
)
.unwrap();
```

> **Note**: While you can put any type that implements these traits in a buffer, using a type that doesn't implement
> the `Send` and `Sync` traits or that isn't `'static` will restrict what you can do with
> that buffer.

While it is sometimes useful to use a buffer that contains a single struct, in practice it is very
common to put an array of values inside of a buffer. You can, for example, put an array of fifty
`i32`s in a buffer with the `CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_data` function.

However in practice it is also very common to not know the size of the array at compile-time. In
order to handle this, `CpuAccessibleBuffer` provides a `from_iter` constructor that takes an
iterator to the data as the last parameter, instead of the data itself.

In the example below, we create a buffer that contains the value `5` of type `u8`, 128 times. The
type of the content of the buffer is `[u8]`, which, in Rust, represents an array of `u8`s whose size
is only known at runtime.

```rust
let iter = (0..128).map(|_| 5u8);
let buffer = CpuAccessibleBuffer::from_iter(
    device.clone(),
    BufferUsage {
        uniform_buffer: true,
        ..Default::default()
    },
    false,
    iter,
)
.unwrap();
```

## Reading and writing the contents of a buffer

Once a `CpuAccessibleBuffer` is created, you can access its content with the `read()` or `write()`
methods. Using `read()` will grant you shared access to the content of the buffer, and using
`write()` will grant you exclusive access. This is similar to using a `RwLock`.

For example if `buffer` contains a `MyStruct` (see above):

```rust
let mut content = buffer.write().unwrap();
// `content` implements `DerefMut` whose target is of type `MyStruct` (the content of the buffer)
content.a *= 2;
content.b = 9;
```

Alternatively, suppose that the content of `buffer` is of type `[u8]` (like with the example that
uses `from_iter`):

```rust
let mut content = buffer.write().unwrap();
// this time `content` derefs to `[u8]`
content[12] = 83;
content[7] = 3;
```

Just like the constructors, keep in mind that being able to read/write the content of the buffer
like this is specific to the `CpuAccessibleBuffer`. Other kinds of buffers (for example the
`DeviceLocalBuffer`) do not provide such methods.
